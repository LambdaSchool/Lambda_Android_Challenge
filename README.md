# Lambda_Android_Challenge

If you have not yet filled out the form at [lambdaschool.com/android-challenge/](https://lambdaschool.com/android-challenge/) please do that before submitting your challenge.

In order to remove even more barriers for those that want to participate in Lambda School, we've created the Lambda Challenge. Based on our data, we are confident that if you can complete the Lambda Challenge, we can help you learn to code, and get a job as an Android developer. 

If the questions in here are too difficult then you can begin working through our regular precourse work which covers the fundamentals [here](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/android/intro/).

You should also complete an application for our iOS course if you have not already done so. Apply [here](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/android/intro/apply/).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this challenge you will need a basic understanding of the following concepts:

```
Java
  constants and variables
  types such as String, int, Boolean, etc.
  conditionals
  loops
  methods
  collections
  classes
```

## The Challenge

Join the Android Lambda Challenge Classroom [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/XBPZGf9). If you have never used repl.it before, you will need to sign up for a free account.

You will then see a list of assignments. Please complete them in order (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, etc.). Repl.it works like an online Swift Playground. You are able to write and run code there directly. It will also test your code to make sure it works. The tests can be somewhat finnicky, so the instructions may tell you to do something like print a variable or function in order for the tests to test your code correctly.

**To allow testing to work, be sure to make all members public unless otherwise specified.**

**Please be sure to read all of the instructions.**

## Finishing Up

When you've finished, send an email to [karen@lambdaschool.com](mailto:karen@lambdaschool.com)

Once we have verified that you passed the repl.it assignments, we will send you an email to schedule an interview.
